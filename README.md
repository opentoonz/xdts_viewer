## What is XDTS Viewer?

XDTS Viewer is a software to view XDTS files and draw notes like a paper exposure sheet. The main features are as follows:

- Consistency : It reproduces as much as possible the layout of the paper timesheets which have been long used in the Japanese animation industry.
- Simplisity : As the name implies, this software (for now) can only view XDTS files, not edit them. It focuses on the ability to manually draw all sorts of information not contained in the XDTS file wherever you want, keeping it simple to use.
